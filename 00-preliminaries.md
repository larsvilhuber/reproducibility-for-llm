# Preliminaries

In this document, we focus on *computational reproducibility*, though the ultimate goal remains replicability. We will consider both LLM-based research as well as research using artificial intelligence (AI) services. The difference may be just a matter of scale of training materials, and offline vs. online use of tools, soemthing we will explore. 

We point to other resources for basic concepts of reproducibility.
