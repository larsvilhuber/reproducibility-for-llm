# Introduction

AI introduces **challenges for reproducibility**.

-- 

Not unlike **difficulties** researchers face with

- any black-box systems
- existing commercial software
- external APIs of any kind

-- 

I will discuss 

- algorithmic transparency
- data dependencies
- archiving machine learning models

## Computational reproducibility

In this talk, we focus on **computational reproducibility**, though the ultimate goal remains *replicability*. 

## LLM vs. AI

I will distinguish **LLM** (large language models) from **AI** (artificial intelligence):

- LLM: models that are trained for a specific (possibly broad) purpose
- AI: online systems that use LLMs, such as GPT, Claude, etc.

## My background

- Data Editor for journals of the American Economic Association
- 1700+ reproducibility packages
- but: ⚠️ almost none with LLM or AI!

## Reproducibility may be hard but important
